##  [Track](track.md)

Creation and tracking the life cycle of the assets in the Blockchain. An asset
is a digital representation of a real asset in the physical world. Using this module you can
record immutable information that uniquely characterizes the asset and update its attributes inherently linked to the instant it was created/updated, so you do not need a trusted third party to certify the existence of that information at any time since you recorded it.

## [Token](token.md)

Creation and management of transferable tokens to build new markets, gamification strategies and easily create transferable value on the network. Applications can issue tokens, transfer them, lock them, etc., keeping at any time an absolute and certain control of the property or rights of use over it. ERC20 and ERC721 standards are implemented to make easier any kind of integration or migration with/from external environments.

## [Settlement](settle.md)

Settled visions of fragmented views. Generation of general structure for reconciling activity records or aggregation operations.

## [Trust](trust.md)
