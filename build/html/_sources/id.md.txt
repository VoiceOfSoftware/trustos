# TrustID
 
TrustID is a standalone identity module for TrustOS. We followed a decentralized identity approach for its design, where users (and services) are identified through a DID. 

These DIDs follow the W3C standard, and they serve as a unique ID to identify users. DIDs aggregate all the pieces of public information required to authenticate a user (i.e., their public key or X.509 certificate).

This is the structure of a DID Identity

- `id` :  `<string>` Unique identifier of the identity using the W3C standard
- `pubkey` :  `<String>` Public key of the identity
- `privkey` :  `<string>` Private key of the identity
- `type` :  `<string>` Algorithm used in order to generate the keys 
- `controller` :  `<String>` Verifier of the identity. In future, an identity should have more than one controller

This is the structure of a service identity


- `serviceID` :  `<string>` Unique identifier for the service
- `Name` :  `<string>` Chaincode or smart contract identifier at the DLT level
- `Controller` :  `<string>` Owner/admin of the service
- `Access` :  `<string>` Access policy to the service.
- `Channel` :  `<string>` Network ID of the service 

Example: 

```
{
  "serviceID":  "track",
  "name": "trackscc",
  "access": {
  	"policy": "PUBLIC"
  },
  "channel": "telefonicachannel"
}
```

In order to uniquely identify chaincodes and services deployed in TrustOS, we decided to also give them DIDs so that they could be seamlessly discovered and accessed even if they "live" in independent channels not shared by all the organizations of the network. 

All the authentication and management of identities in the system is performed on-chain through an "Identity Chaincode."

If user A wants to start interacting with the network, he requests the generation of a new DID. The related keys to this DID could be an existing X.509 issued by a valid organization, or even an Ethereum-related public key (internally we use all the JWS, JWE, JWK, secp256k1, etc. RFCs to make our Fabric infrastructure compatible with identities of any nature for the sake of interoperability). This DID generation request has to be validated by a valid organization of the network. Once verified, every transaction signed by user A and directed through a Proxy chaincode is authenticated successfully and delegated to the corresponding chaincode.

![TrustID Flow](./images/trustid-flow.png)

The TrustID project is conformed by the aforementioned chaincode and a client SDK to ease the integration and interaction with TrustID-enabled networks.

TrustID is designed to ease the management of identities for the case of TrustOS. Users shouldnâ€™t need to hold a different set of credentials for each network or decentralized application they interact with. The same credentials used to access your owned Bitcoins and manage your tokens in Ethereum should let you update the state of a Fabric asset or launch a secondary market in TrustOS.

## ID API

An abstraction TrustID API implementation. It wraps the functionality of the TrustID SDK in order to offer basic identity management services to users comfortable delegating the responsability of their keys to a custodian. ID API acts as the third-party custodian of the users keys.


### API Specification

The implementation considers that the API is the third-party custodial of
TrustID keys. Currently the keystore is implemented with a FileKeystore,
MongoKeystore comming soon. Private keys from users are stored ciphered
with a passphrase. In order to call every function and unlock the account
the passphrase needs to be provided. The API has the following routes.


### Identity Methods

#### POST   -   `/id/login`
It return a JWT to interact with services authenticated
using JWT using TrustID as identity backend. This functionality is offered
for every user in the system (even those for which we are not the
custodials of the keys). Some services may be still authenticated with JWT,
and we want to support this authentication even of TrustID users.
- `id` :  `<string>` Unique identifier of the user
- `password`    :  `<string>` Password of the user

## TrustID SDK

This SDK exposes all the functionalities required to interact with
TrustID-based DLT networks. 

### Install
* To install this library you need access to the private repo:
```
npm install trustos-trustid-sdk
```

### Structure
The library has the following modules:

#### Wallet

* `wallet.ts`: Core module of the library. It wraps all the state and
logic for identity management and interaction with TrustID networks.
To start using the SDK a new wallet needs to be initialized. A wallet
exposes the following methods:
    * `public setKeystore(keystore: Keystore): void`:
    * `public generateDID(type: string, controller: string, passphrase): DID`
    

#### Class DID
* `class DID`: Has the following structure. 
  * `public id: string`: Id string that identifies the DID.
  * `public pubkey: string`: PublicKey of the DID.
  * `public type: string`: Key type (RSA / EC / OKP).
  * `public controller: string`: Verifier of the identity
  * `public access: number`: Access level
  * `private privkey: string`: Private Key of the DID.

And exposes the following functions:
  * `public unlockAccount(passphrase: string): void`: Unlocks private key in order to use the DID.
  * `public unlockAccount(passphrase: string): void`: Unlocks private key with a temporal key in order to use the DID.
  * `public lockAccount(): any`: Locks the private key for a DID.
  * `public sign(payload: object, passphrase: string): string`: Sign a payload with a specific DID.
  * `public verify(signature: string, id: string): any`: Verifies a signature from a DID.

#### TrustID operations

* `TrustID.ts`: Interface that enables the inteoperation  between the drivers and the different  functionalities of TrustID. The only component implemented currently is the `trustIDhf.ts` enabling the interaction with Hyperledger Fabric TrustID
networks.

  * `setEndpoint(endpoint: string): void`: Sets the network endpoint to interact with the TrustID network.
  * `createIdentity(did: DID): Promise<object>`: Create an identity in TrustID. It generates a new DID in the wallet and register it in the network.
  * `verifyIdentity(adminDID: DID, id:string): Promise<object>`: Verifies an identity as an admin.
  * `getIdentity(did: DID, id: string): * Promise<object>`: Gets a registered identity from TrustID.
  * `revokeIdentity(adminDID: DID, id: string): Promise<object>`: Revokes a registered identity. Only supported by the owner or controller of the DID.
  * `createService(did: DID, serviceDID: string, name: string, isPublic: boolean): Promise<object>`: Creates a new service in the TrustID network.
  * `updateService(did: DID, serviceDID: string, access: Access, isPublic: boolean): Promise<object>`: Updates the information from a service.
  * `getService(did: DID, serviceDID: string): Promise<object>`: Gets information from a registered service.
  * `invoke (did: DID, serviceDID: string, args: string[], channel: string): Promise<object>`: Invokes a function of a registered service in the TrustID network.
  * `query(did: DID, serviceDID: string, args: string[], channel: string): Promise<object>`: Queries a function of a registered service in the TrustID network

#### Driver operations

* `driver.ts`: Interface that enables the implementation of connection drivers with different TrustID networks. The only driver implemented currently is
the `hfdriver.ts` enabling the interaction with Hyperledger Fabric TrustID
networks.

  * `connect(config: object): Promise<object>;`: Connects with a DLT networks
  * `disconnect(config: object): void`: Disconnects of a DLT network 
  * `checkConnection(channelName?:string): Promise<object>`: Check the connection with a DLT
  *  `callContractTransaction(id: string, fcn: string, args: any, channel?: string): Promise<object>`: Write operation in the DLT
  *  `getContractTransaction(id: string, fcn: string, args: any, channel?: string): Promise<object>`: Read operation in the DLT

#### Keystore

* `keystore.ts`: Interface that enables the implementation of keystore storages.
    There are currently two implementations of keystore supported: `FileKeystore.ts` (to store DIDs in file keystore)and `MongoKeystore.ts` (to store DIDs in MongoDB). 

    * `abstract getDID(id: string): DID`: It gets specific DID from keystore.
    * `abstract storeDID(did: DID): boolean`: It stores DID in keystore.
    * `abstract updateDID(did: DID): boolean`: It updates DID in keystore.
    * `public storeInMemory(did: DID): boolean`: Stores DID inMemory for easy and performant use.
    * `public listDID(): string[]`: List DIDs in memory.
    * `public setDefault(did: DID): boolean`: Set DID as default identity for the keystore wallet.

### Example of use
```js
// Use library
var id = require('trustos-trustid-sdk')
import { Keystore } from './keystore/keystore';

// Initialize wallet
wal = id.Wallet.Instance;

// Initialize new FileKeystore with storage at ./keystore
const ks = new sdk.FileKeystore("file", "./keystore");
wal.setKeystore(ks)
// ccp is the configu file of a Hyperledger Fabric network
const ccp = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync("../ccp-dev-dsn.json", 'utf8'));
const config = { // additional config to connect with hyperledger fabric
    stateStore: '/tmp/statestore',
    caURL: 'https://ca:7054',
    caName: 'ca',
    caAdmin: 'admin',
    caPassword: 'password',
    tlsOptions: {
        trustedRoots: "Certificate",
        verify: false
    },
    mspId: 'telefonicaMSP',
    walletID: 'admin',
    asLocalhost: false,
    ccp: ccp,
    chaincodeName: "identitycc", //name of the trustid contract deployed on fabric
    fcn: "proxy",
    channel: "channel1"
}


// Create HF driver to interact with a hyperledger fabric network
var trustID = new sdk.TrustIdHf(config);
// Add and configure the network driver in our wallet.
wal.addNetwork("hf", trustID);
await wal.networks["hf"].configureDriver()

// IDENTITY OPERATION
 // Generate key pair locally.
const did = await wal.generateDID("RSA", "test", "test")
await did.unlockAccount("test")
    // Register in the platform.
await wal.networks.hf.createSelfIdentity(did)
 wal.setDefault(did)
// Get the registered identity.
let res = await wal.networks.hf.getIdentity(did, did.id)
console.log("[*] Get registered identity\n", res)

//SERVICES OPERATIONS
await wal.networks.hf.createService(did, "coren-trackscc", "track", "PUBLIC", "channel1")

let res = await wal.networks.hf.getService(did, "coren-trackscc")
// Create an asset in the service: Track operation via trustid
const asset = {assetId: "test"+Date.now(), data:{"a":1, "b":2}, metadata: {"c": 4}}
const assetStr = JSON.stringify(asset)
// Invoke tract
res = await wal.networks.hf.invoke(did, "coren-trackscc",["createAsset", assetStr], "channel1")
console.log("[*] Asset creation:\n", res)
    // Get the created asset.
res = await wal.networks.hf.invoke(did, "coren-trackscc",["getAsset", JSON.stringify({assetId: asset.assetId})], "channel1")
console.log("[*] Asset registered\n", res)

## Roadmap
- TrustID compatible with Hyperledger Indy, Verifiable Credentials, etc
- Anonymous authentication with anonymous transactions
- Integration with other Identity Providers, related with the non-blockchain world.
- Support for other Keys algorithms, now only RSA is supported
- Compatibility with Ethereum keys.
